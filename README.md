A discord bot that displays a shared movie watchlist! (Good for individual use amongst a small group of servers - not for public distribution since the file is stored locally)

This is my experimentations with learning how to make a discord bot so don't expect the world's most polished code!

You'll need to have nodejs and discord.js installed and add a movieList.json file to the root directory with the following format, for it to run:

``
{
  "currentFilm" = "",
  "movies" = []
}
``
